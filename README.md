Hello World!

I'm Tim and I like to write code that I can still understand a year later. I'm probably the only software developer on Earth who doesn't regularly drink coffee. Programming languages with duck typing scare me - seriously though, why would you do that?

I think it's important to be kind to our planet. If we dedicate our first experiences in a new field to the world, we might also wanna save the world
